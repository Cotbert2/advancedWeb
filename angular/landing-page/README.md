# 💼 My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! 🚀

This project showcases who I am, what I’ve built, and what I can offer as a developer. Through this site, I aim to give visitors an interactive and visually engaging experience of my professional profile — including my background, projects, skills, and contact information.

## 📜 About This Portfolio

I started this project to have a central place to share my work, my interests in technology, and my journey through software development. From high school experiments with code to more refined university projects, every section of this site reflects my growth and passion for tech.

### 🔍 Sections Included:
- **$whoami**: A brief personal introduction.
- **$tree ./projects**: A visual listing of my projects and technologies used.
- **$cat ./experience**: A summary of my background and skills.
- **$./contactme.sh**: Simple and direct ways to get in touch with me.

Each section draws inspiration from Linux commands — reflecting my comfort with the command line and a hacker-style aesthetic. The UI design mimics a terminal environment, blended with dark mode styling and lightweight SVG icons for a sleek and modern experience.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Angular** – Main framework for building the app.
- **TypeScript** – For type-safe, scalable frontend logic.
- **HTML/CSS** – Custom styling and responsive layout.
- **PrimeNG** – For UI components.
- **Devicon** – For technology stack icons.
- **SCSS** – To maintain modular and maintainable styles.
- **Signals** – Angular’s reactive approach to state management in the latest version.

## 🎯 Why Angular?

This project was specifically developed using **Angular** due to a university requirement for a course. While I believe Angular is a powerful framework — especially for building complex, enterprise-level applications — it may not be the most suitable or lightweight choice for a personal portfolio like this one.

Frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, or even **static site generators** like **Astro** or **Next.js** would typically be better suited for this type of site, offering faster load times, better performance for static content, and simpler build processes. However, fulfilling the academic requirement gave me the chance to dive deeper into Angular and challenge myself to create a performant, well-structured application under those constraints.
