        <h2>My manifesto</h2>
        “The current conditions of life are not bearable in the long run, technology is a tool that allows us to progress, however, freedom under it is surrounded by pollution and access only to those who have resources under the material bias.
        My life goal is to change the world by contributing from the minimum with the intention of achieving a significant change in people's lives. Likewise, respect for animal life and awareness of reproduction, following the principles of Objectivism proposed by Ayn Rand.”
