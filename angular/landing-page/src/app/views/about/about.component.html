            <p>
                I found myself in the IT world when I was 15 years old, when I started to learn about programming
                and technology. <br> <br>
                I started at 2020 pandmeic, when I was in high school, and I started to learn about programming with
                Java, then i fell in love with different branches of development.<br> <br>
                I go through desktop applications, web development, mobile applications, embedded systems and then I
                found another passion: cybersecurity.<br> <br>
                I realeased my first app in 2021, a  Morse code translator that was available on the Play Store.
                I started developing malware and pentesting, I found my first vulnerability when I was 17.
                My porpouse is to learn as much as I can about technology and programming, and to be able to share
                that knowledge with others. <br> <br>
                I am a passionate developer, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. <br> <br>

        <h2>My manifesto</h2>
        “The current conditions of life are not bearable in the long run, technology is a tool that allows us to progress, however, freedom under it is surrounded by pollution and access only to those who have resources under the material bias.
        My life goal is to change the world by contributing from the minimum with the intention of achieving a significant change in people's lives. Likewise, respect for animal life and awareness of reproduction, following the principles of Objectivism proposed by Ayn Rand.”
